### Tron-App

Version
0.2.0

(for the forseeable future, 0.x of CLI will stay synced with 0.x of app)

This project is not meant to be used without Tron-CLI. Users are welcome to use this alone, but my intention
is that you'd never NPM install this module. Instead you'd use Tron-CLI to create an Electron application
which in turn would pull in this module as a dependency.
